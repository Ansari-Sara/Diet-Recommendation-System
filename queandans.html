          1) What is a "Healthy Diet"?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            A healthy eating pattern is one that provides enough of each essential nutrient from nutrient-dense foods, contains a variety of foods from all of the basic food groups, and focuses on balancing calories consumed with calories expended to help you achieve and sustain a healthy weight. This eating pattern limits intake of solid fats, sugar, salt (sodium), and alcohol.

          2) How much of a nutrient is too much?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) defines the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) as the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population. This level is different for each nutrient.

          3) How is food digested?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            Digestion begins in the mouth, when we chew and swallow, and is completed in the small intestine. Digestion involves the mixing of food, its movement through the digestive tract, and the breakdown of food into smaller molecules.

          4) What foods cause gas and bloating?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            There are many possible causes of gas and bloating, including:
            Swallowing more air than usual (e.g., when chewing gum or drinking carbonated [fizzy] drinks)
            Eating certain foods or drinks (e.g., “sugar-free” products made with sugar alcohols)
            Having certain digestive disorders (e.g., Celiac Disease, gastritis, Irritable Bowel Syndrome [IBS], or food allergies and intolerances)

          5) How can I burn off my stored body fat?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            We all need some body fat, but if stored fat is excessive it may increase the risk of diet-related diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. This is particularly true if excess fat is in the abdominal area. According to the CDC, a body mass index, or BMI, of 25 or higher is an indication that your weight may be unhealthy. The best strategy for losing excess weight and stored body fat involves calorie reduction, increased physical activity, and a behavior change plan.

          6) I'm on a diet to lose weight. Do I still need to exercise?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            Physical activity is a key component of helping you move toward a healthier weight, as it can help you achieve the appropriate calorie balance. People who exercise regularly may be more likely to keep the weight from coming back after losing weight.

          7) Is it okay to skip meals if I have a heavy breakfast?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper” goes the old saying. However, our lifestyles have become much more sedentary since feudal times. Eating a large breakfast if you are just going to be sitting at your desk the entire day isn’t recommended. It also doesn’t mean skipping lunch if you’ve eaten a lot in the morning. Instead, spread your calorie intake through the day. Large gaps between meals might lead to hyperacidity.

          8) Why should one eat every 2 – 3 hours even if not hungry? Won’t eating so often cause weight gain?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            If you wait until you are hungry, you will eat more than you should be eating. Eating wholesome, balanced meals and snacks every 2 – 3 hours helps keep your metabolism high [which is the key to fat loss], blood sugar levels stable, and energy levels high. It is important to spread your overall calorie intake through the day and include all six food groups [starch, fruits, vegetables, meat/protein, dairy, and fats] in your daily meal plan.

          9) Why do we have to eat banana, chikoo (sapota), and mango in moderation?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            These fruits contain more sugar than some other fruits, so the serving sizes are smaller for these fruits as they contain more calories. Half a medium-size mango and half a banana have the same calories as a tennis-ball size apple. The best time to have a banana, mango, or chikoo is post an aerobic workout such as a run to help replenish energy stores in your muscles.

          10) Which is the healthiest cooking oil?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            All oils, with the exception of palm oils, are healthy when used in small amounts. It is best to use a variety of oils for cooking—rice bran oil, vegetable oil, soybean oil, groundnut oil. Keep changing your oil every month; that way you can get both the heart-healthy fats—monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats—in your diet.

          11) Is it okay to eat something immediately after exercise? If yes, what to eat?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            As per research, consuming a combination of carbohydrates [such as fruit, fruit juice, or a sports drink] and a protein supplement [such as a whey protein isolate powder, which is made from milk] within 20 minutes of your workout allows for the best utilization of the protein by your body. A whey protein supplement could help increase your stamina, strength, and endurance as proteins are the building blocks of muscle tissue.

      <div class="faq">
        <button class="accordion">
          12) Is it okay to drink water immediately after eating meals?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            As per Ayurveda, drinking water immediately after meals dilutes the digestive juices, thereby slowing down digestion. It is best to drink water 30 minutes before or after a meal. Also, drink room temperature water or warm water, as it helps digestion. Cold water, on the other hand, hampers digestion and is best avoided.

          13) Will avoiding eating meals after 7pm help in weight loss?
          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            Yes, it helps. Most people become less active after 7pm. And also the metabolism is slower towards the end of the day. Hence, the calorie intake should be less as the day comes to a close.

        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            For general fitness, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week, along with muscle-strengthening exercises on two or more days. For weight loss or specific fitness goals, you might need to increase the duration and intensity of your workouts.

          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            It’s possible to lose weight by focusing on diet alone, especially if you create a calorie deficit through food choices. However, combining diet with exercise can enhance results, improve overall health, and support muscle maintenance.

        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            A common recommendation is to drink about 8 cups (64 ounces) of water per day, but individual needs can vary. Factors such as activity level, climate, and personal health can influence hydration needs. Listening to your body and staying hydrated is key.

        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            Foods with protein are the best options for midnight snacks. A cup of skim milk, two-thirds cup of probiotic plain yoghurt, and even casein protein, which is a slow-release protein supplement, are a few good options.

          <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            Fiber aids in digestion, helps maintain healthy blood sugar levels, and promotes satiety. Aim to include fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts in your diet. The recommended daily intake is about 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men.

        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            Eating well is good, but you need to be hydrating well too. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include fatigue, nausea, headache, and dry skin. Ensure that you are drinking enough water and other healthy fluids, like coconut water, unsweetened juices, soups, lemon juice, and herbal teas. The color of your urine is a fairly reliable marker of your levels of hydration. If it’s darker than pale yellow, you need more fluids.

        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            Staying motivated can be challenging, but setting realistic goals, tracking progress, finding activities you enjoy, and seeking support from friends or a community can help. Establishing a routine and focusing on the benefits of a healthy lifestyle can also keep you motivated.
